Hi folks, I am Debarghya Datta, a BTech student from the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology. I am a Data Science enthusiast and is following this field for quite a time. I always wanted to know the machine learning concepts from the root, so I started learning Maths and Statistics, which forms the base for any Machine Learning algorithms. I am on a journey of learning Data Science through various MOOCs and by reading a bunch of articles, if you want to learn something out of it, you can tag along.  

You can contact me on any handles given below.:relaxed:
